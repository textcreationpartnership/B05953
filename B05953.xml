         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Supplemental Word, neceſſary to be made known, and underſtood aright, and to be done accordingly, in order to the <hi>Healing of theſe Nations.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHen the <hi>French</hi> were moving upon the Waters in the Year 1692. It was given out throughout all this Nation, To make the People more Unanimous in oppoſition of them, That they came to ſpoil and make a Conqueſt over this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. They did not then come ſo near, as to ſend out their Declarations, and make their Pretences known. But if they had, and declared accordingly, That they came only to reſtore the deprived King; And that they did covet and deſign no more than barely to effect This; and they would be contented only with the Charge of the Expedition paid, with ſome moderate Gratuities to the Souldiers and Seamen; and henceforward theſe Nations ſhould abide by one another in Unity, Peace and Concord: If the uſual Conſultation, Treaty and Security was had hereupon, the People of <hi>England</hi> might credit and fully rely on theſe their ſo far ſeeming Reaſonable and juſt Demands, all one as they did take the <hi>P.</hi> of <hi>O.</hi> his Word to let him come in when he had before declared, That He did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make a Conqueſt over them. Indeed there is ſomewhat more to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the diſparity of the Numbers and Power which the One hath over what the Other had. But the Word and Promiſe of the Princes and Potentates of the Earth is much alike, that there is no ſure Truſt and Reliance to be given to any of them. They were wont to ſpeak in old Time, ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely ask Counſel at</hi> Abel, and ſo they ended the matter 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.18. As we are allowed, yea, and commanded to ſearch the Scriptures, ſo any one at his leiſure may read the four following <hi>Verſes,</hi> as they lie open in the Bible. I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in <hi>England.</hi> It ſeemeth hard and unequal to me, that a whole Nation ſhould be endangered to be ruined, and ſwallowed up by Strangers and Forreigners for the Ambition and Contention of two Men. Whereas Right might be done in a Peaceable and Prudent way (without their Aid, or violent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſure and medling) upon the terms of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Forgiveneſs,</hi> not one Man excepted. But if one is ſo ſtiff as not to grant that; As I ſuppoſe He would be glad with all his Heart, and conſent to be Re-admitted in upon thoſe mild and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable Conditions, which will make him both Revered and Loved; for it is neither Duty, nor yet Wiſdom to ſpeak or behave ones ſelf Proudly in the day of Diſtreſs. They are Adverſaries to the King, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.22. and they hinder his Reſtauration, who dictate otherwiſe notwithſtanding their ignorant Zeal, and vain Talk for him. And if the Offenders are afraid to truſt to this, as Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Guilt is very timorous and ſuſpicious (it being but what is natural and uſual, That they who have tranſgreſſed without a Cauſe, ſhould be alſo fearful without a Cauſe, that is, without a true Cauſe.) Then let all thoſe that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed criminal ſtand by themſelves; for there is no reaſon why others, who as yet are not ſo, should make themſelves criminal alſo in defending them. And let him come ſingly to punish them, whilſt all others ſtand perfectly Neuter, and Diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted as to that Cauſe, only in defence of their Country, to ſtop the Incurſion and Spoil of Strangers and Robbers. The right underſtanding of, and acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Truth, would go a great way towards the bringing and ſetling Peace again in our Borders.</p>
